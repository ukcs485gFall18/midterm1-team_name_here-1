## Our App
Our midterm application is based on a tutorial for “OneHourWalker,” an application that is used to demonstrate how to access and write to HealthKit on iOS.  The application is able to start and stop a timer for your walk and then use the information collected to enable you to share the details of your activity to HealthKit, which holds your health data.
### Functionality 1: (Darren Powers)
 The first of the added functionalities, using the HealthKit EnergyBurned Goal, was the first to be added.  We knew what our application should allow the user to do, so after researching HealthKit we saw that users could set an energy burned goal (an object - activeEnergyBurnedGoal: HKQuantity) which we could display as well as display the amount of energy burned toward that goal (another object -  activeEnergyBurned: HK Quantity)
### Functionality 2: (Josh Terrell)
For this application an important functionality that we would like to incorporate are goals and achievements. When the user reaches a certain fitness goal, like energy burned, they will get an achievement. The achievement system is to help the user obtain the goals they set for themselves, giving them something tangible.
### Functionality 3: (Siyuan Chen)
This application only has the functionality of recording walking and running distance, which is not really useful for someone who is looking for an application that can record more, varied exercises. So, we decided to add more exercises to record like jogging, running inside, riding bike, sit-up, push-up, climbing and so on. However, because of our limited time, we chose to only add riding bike for the midterm app with plans to add the remainder to our final application.
